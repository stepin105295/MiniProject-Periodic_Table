# Project Information

Everyone may not know all the information about each element, sometimes you need someone or something that you can refer to make sure that you are handling the right information, like someone once said “Half knowledge is worse than ignorance”. So it will be super nice if we were to know someone who can provide you the answers to your questions regarding those ever evasive values or information that is vital.

This project is for all those chemistry lovers out there who might have a hard time to find some of the essential details of each element. The Periodic Table Assistant is the right tool for you, it helps you with all the details of the known periodic table elements. Its is made quite easy to find the details of the required elements just by searching the using their name, symbol, atomic number or atomic mass
